# Supermarket-Billing-System
**A C program which demonstrates an easy-to-use automated billing system.**

This is a mini-project which I undertook while studying in the 2nd Semester of my CSE under-graduation course.
It was developed on an Ubuntu operating system and is based on the C language.

**Instructions to give input:**
1. Enter the date when prompted to do so.
2. Enter the code number of the product when prompted to do so and press 'enter' (The code corresponds to the serial number of the products listed on the screen).
3. Enter the quantity of the particular product bought and press 'enter'.
4. Perform steps 2 and 3 for all products being bought.
5. Press 'space' and then 'enter' when you are done.
6. Enter the amount received from the customer and press 'enter'.
7. The bill generation is complete.
